Monsanto sent several of our IT staff to [AWS re:Invent][reinvent]
last week. We learned a lot and were excited to hear about the new
services announced, especially those around the EC2 Container Service,
Kinesis, IoT, AWS Config, and the data import/export device Snowball.
We also gave a few talks and look forward to connecting and
collaborating with the many that came up after the talks and spoke to
us. If you couldn't attend in person, have a look and
[let us know what you think][contact].
