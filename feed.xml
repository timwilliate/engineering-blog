                <title>Cloud Foundry Metrics</title>
                
                
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;In the second installation of our open source &lt;a href=&quot;http://engineering.monsanto.com/2015/07/22/building-an-open-source-cloud-foundry-toolbox/&quot;&gt;Cloud Foundry (CF) toolbox series&lt;/a&gt; we would like to introduce &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/MonsantoCo/cf-metrics&quot;&gt;CF-Metrics&lt;/a&gt;, a comprehensive solution for Cloud Foundry monitoring and alerting based solely on open source projects.  In a world of unreliable cloud infrastructure and distributed micro service architectures, monitoring and alerting are as critical now as they&amp;#39;ve ever been.  Even when you learn to expect failure (or better yet &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/strepsirrhini-army/chaos-lemur&quot;&gt;embrace it&lt;/a&gt;) and build self healing platforms like Cloud Foundry, you still need monitoring and alerting to analyze why there was a failure and how to make it not happen again in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Building a simple Spray application</title>
                
                
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ve probably heard people talk about Spray by now; maybe you&amp;#39;re
even using it for JSON serialization.  Spray also provides a
lightweight server package to allow you easily create REST services.
The hardest part of getting started with any new technology is getting
past that initial contact of setup and concepts.  I&amp;#39;ll try to reduce
that hurdle by walking you through a simple app that hits most of the
features you might regularly use.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the third post in our series on Scala implicits. The earlier posts cover &lt;a href=&quot;http://engineering.monsanto.com/2015/05/14/implicits-intro/&quot;&gt;implicit type parameters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://engineering.monsanto.com/2015/06/15/implicits-futures/&quot;&gt;implicit parameters with futures&lt;/a&gt;. In this post, we discuss implicit conversions.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;This segment of our open source Cloud Foundry (CF) toolbox series introduces &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/MonsantoCo/cf-portal&quot;&gt;CF-Portal&lt;/a&gt;, a basic read-only view into your Cloud Foundry application landscape.  CF-Portal was one of the first applications we made for our CF toolbox, since unlike the branded CF offerings, the community project lacks any pre-packaged UI.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>PaaSify your Apps</title>
                
                
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;The age of cloud computing is already here, and companies who don&amp;#39;t adapt are at serious risk of getting left in the dust.  At Monsanto we have fully embraced the transformation this revolution has brought and are diligently on the path towards a modern IT landscape focused around public cloud, microservices, open source technologies, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://12factor.net/&quot;&gt;12 factor apps&lt;/a&gt;.  Transformations however, rarely happen overnight and like most enterprise companies we were starting the journey with a datacenter full of legacy and not-so-cloudy apps.  So our first step was to adopt
&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/overview.html&quot;&gt;Cloud Foundry&lt;/a&gt;, an open platform as a service which allowed our dev teams to start learning/adopting cloud designs on top of an agile platform in the safety of our private datacenter.  &lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Stax</title>
                
                
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;When we were looking to build out an infrastructure in AWS (&lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com&quot;&gt;Amazon Web Services&lt;/a&gt;), we took some time to understand how the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/aws/aws-cli&quot;&gt;aws-cli&lt;/a&gt; (Universal Command Line Interface for Amazon Web Services) worked. With ideas from other projects found on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, we started wrapping commands in simple BASH scripts, and pointed it to CloudFormation templates written in JSON. From there &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/monsantoco/stax&quot;&gt;stax&lt;/a&gt; was born, and we have released it as open source under the &lt;a href=&quot;http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause&quot;&gt;BSD 3-clause license&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Doing Docker Metrics</title>
                
                
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;As our usage of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.docker.com&quot;&gt;Docker&lt;/a&gt; grows and we provision more container hosts, collecting metrics and monitoring containers and hosts has become a necessity. This post will walk you through how to glue together a few components to deploy a monitoring solution for Docker. All components are intentionally plug-and-play, so if things need to be changed any component can be (relatively) easily swapped out for an alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
