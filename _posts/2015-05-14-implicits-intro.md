Implicits are arguably <span class="banana">the most</span> unique and
misunderstood language feature of Scala.  Unlike other advanced features in the
language, they are very hard to avoid: most major libraries in Scala, starting
from Scala collections, make heavy use of implicits. That use is not invisible
to the users of the library, especially when we choose to look at the code. The
other tricky part about implicits is that there are so many ways to use them,
each with a different reason and pattern.  They can't be fully explained in one
coherent post.

This post explains one important use pattern on implicit parameters. It's a
good place to start for understanding the hows and whys of Scala implicits.

Reflection lets us ask about type information at runtime.  Java provides the
`.class` method on all objects, but it is limited: type parameters are
invisible at runtime.  Scala's TypeTags can give us details about type
parameters that the Java compiler would normally erase.  And what is the
easiest and most common way of obtaining a TypeTag? An implicit parameter.

So for this exercise, we'll see <span class="get-inner-type">a little
method</span> that takes a List, and returns the <span class="type-name">type
name</span> of the <span class="T"> contents of the list</span> .

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-scala" data-lang="scala">import scala.reflect.runtime.universe._

def <span class="get-inner-type">getInnerType[<span class="T">T</span>]</span>(list:List[<span class="T">T</span>])(implicit tag:TypeTag[<span class="T">T</span>]) = tag.<span class="type-name">tpe.toString</span>
</code></pre></div>

Using that method, we can report on the inner type of a list:

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-scala" data-lang="scala">val stringList: List[String] = List("A")
val stringName = <span class="get-inner-type">getInnerType</span>(stringList)
println( s"a list of $stringName")
</code></pre></div>

will print out

```scala
a list of java.lang.String
```

Great, we defeated erasure! But how did this work? How did that
implicit TypeTag get there? Compiler magic!

The easiest way to think about implicit parameters is that they are
extra parameters to a function that can be populated by the compiler
instead of being passed manually. In the case of TypeTags and
ClassTags, we do not have to do anything to make them work: the
compiler will always be able to provide an implicit TypeTag or
ClassPath parameter for all real classes (as opposed to generics,
which we'll cover in a minute).

The context of the call to getInnerType knows that `stringList` is a
`List[String]`, so the compiler fills in the implicit for us.  The
compiler fills the implicit as if we had called the method like this:

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-scala" data-lang="scala">import scala.reflect.runtime.universe._

val stringList: List[String] = List("A")   
val stringName = <span class="get-inner-type">getInnerType</span>(stringList)<span class="T">(typeTag(String))</span>
println( s"a list of $stringName")
</code></pre></div>

That typeTag method is defined in the scala.reflect.runtime.universe
object, and it triggers the same compiler magic as any request for an
implicit `TypeTag[T]`.  TypeTag is special: instances of TypeTag are
brought into being by Scala's compiler. This contrasts with every
other implicit parameter, supplied (one way or another) by the
programmer. That's why this is a great implicit to start with: see how
to ask for it, before you learn how to supply it.

The compiler is able to provide a TypeTag in this instance, because it
knows the fully qualified type of stringList.  When getInnerType is
invoked, the compiler knows exactly what kind of List the parameter
stringList is.  This would not work if instead of some specific type
(String) the code calling <span
class="get-inner-type">getInnerType</span> used a <span
class="T">generic type</span>.  For example, we will now add a <span
class="grm">gratuitous method</span> that just delegates to <span
class="get-inner-type">getInnerType</span>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-scala" data-lang="scala">import scala.reflect.runtime.universe._

def <span class="grm">gratuitousIntermediateMethod</span>[<span class="T">T</span>](list:List[<span class="T">T</span>]) = <span class="get-inner-type">getInnerType</span>(list)
</code></pre></div>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-scala" data-lang="scala">val stringList: List[String] = List("A") 
val stringName = <span class="grm">gratuitousIntermediateMethod</span>(stringList)
println( s"a list of $stringName")
</code></pre></div>

This code fails to compile though, with this scary compilation error.

<div class="highlight"><pre>Error:(36, 83) No TypeTag available for T
  def gratuitousIntermediateMethod`[`T`]`(list: List`[`T`]`) = getInnerType(list)
</pre></div>

When the compiler tries to work on gratuitousIntermediateMethod, <span
class="T">T</span> is a generic type, so the compiler does not know
what type it represents.  Therefore, it cannot provide the implicit
parameter.  Only the callers to gratuitousIntermediateMethod will know
what the type is, and therefore be able to provide the TypeTag.

So to make this work, the intermediate method needs to request the
TypeTag itself, so that the compiler can pass the TypeTag down to
getInnerType:

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-scala" data-lang="scala">import scala.reflect.runtime.universe._

def <span class="grm">gratuitousIntermediateMethod</span>[<span class="T">T</span>](list:List[<span class="T">T</span>])(implicit tag :TypeTag[<span class="T">T</span>]) =
   getInnerType(list)
</code></pre></div>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-scala" data-lang="scala">val stringList: List[String] = List("A") 
val stringName = <span class="grm">gratuitousIntermediateMethod</span>(stringList)
println( s"a list of $stringName")
</code></pre></div>

This works just like our example without the gratuitous method.

```scala
a list of java.lang.String
```

We need parameters that carry the TypeTag from where the type is
concrete to where the typeTag is needed.  This kind of pattern,
carrying implicits over, happens with other kinds of implicit
parameters: Watch for future posts that reveal other examples of this
implicit-handoff pattern.

Notice that the implicit parameter to getInnerType appears in a second
parameter list.  Implicit parameters are always separated from
explicit parameters this way. We could declare getInnerType with only
one parameter list, all explicit parameters. Then the code would look
like:

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-scala" data-lang="scala">import scala.reflect.runtime.universe._

def getInnerType[<span class="T">T</span>](list:List[<span class="T">T</span>], tag :TypeTag[<span class="T">T</span>]) = tag.tpe.toString
</code></pre></div>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-scala" data-lang="scala">val stringList: List[String] = List("A")
val stringName = getInnerType(stringList, typeTag(String))
println( s"a list of $stringName")
</code></pre></div>

Comparing the code with implicits and the one without, there is one
major difference: The top level code doesn't have a trace of the
TypeTag, so we do not have to know it is required. The compiler takes
care of it. We pay a little bit in complexity in the code that
receives the implicit parameter, in exchange for simpler calling code.
The library author suffers once, while the library clients benefit
many times.  No wonder implicit parameters are used all over the place
in Scala!
